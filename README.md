# Data_Scientist_Blog_Post

This project is part of my Data Sciene Nanodegree project by Udacity.

## Libraries
The developer needs to import the following libraries to run the analysis:
- numpy 
- pandas 
- matplotlib

- seaborn 
- datetime

## Motivation for project

## Dataset
The analysis uses the open dataset [Seattle AirBnB 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) provided by Keggle. It includes the following three files.

- **listings.csv**: full descriptions and average review score
- **reviews.csv**: unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- **calendar.csv**: including listing id and the price and availability for that day

The data cover a date range between 01/04/2016 and 01/02/2017 and include 84849 unique listings.
