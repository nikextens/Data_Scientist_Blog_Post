# Data_Scientist_Blog_Post

This project is part of my Data Sciene Nanodegree project by Udacity.

## Libraries
The developer needs to import the following libraries to run the analysis:
- numpy 
- pandas 
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn 
- datetime

## Motivation for project
When looking at different dataset for that project, the AirBnB dataset caught my attention since I personally often use it when being on vacation - and I even used AirBnB when spending time in Seattle.

The following three business questions motivated me to proceed with my analysis:

1. Which features are associated with higher prices?
2. Is it possible to predict the prices based on the given features?
3. How did the availability by property type develop over time?

The goal of my analysis is to eventually provide insights for both hosts and travelers active on AirBnB.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the open dataset [Seattle AirBnB 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) provided by Keggle. It includes the following three files.

- **listings.csv**: full descriptions and average review score
- **reviews.csv**: unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- **calendar.csv**: including listing id and the price and availability for that day

The data cover a date range between 01/04/2016 and 01/02/2017 and include 84849 unique listings.
